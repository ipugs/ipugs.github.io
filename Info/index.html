		<h2>Rules:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>You must have a mic and be in mumble to play.</li>
				<li>New players, iron and steel players are all welcome, if you play silver you will need to offclass and take it easy. </li>
				<li>We're all here to get better so be able to take criticism and give it out to others in nice and constructive ways.</li>
				<li>Excessive off-classing (Pyro, Sniper, Engineer, etc. when not on last-holds) will not be permitted.</li>
				<li>Trash talking is ok, but to an extent. You will be given a warning on when you're taking it too far.</li>
				<li>Leaving, going afk, griefing and mic spamming are all ways to get you kicked/banned.</li>
				<li>Any player found cheating will be permanently banned.</li>
				<li>The admins/moderators word is final, you can make an appeal in our appeals form (linked below) rather then causing a scene in mumble.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Strike/Ban System:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Being kicked from a pug (maximum of 3 times) for breaking any rule above will result in a 1-3 month ban depending on what they were for.</li>
				<li>Each kick counts as 1 strike out of the 3 strikes you have.</li>
				<li>After your ban you may return to our pugs, if you are kicked 1 more time you will be banned for a minimum of 3 months.</li>
				<li>If you would like to challenge a ban or strike you can post in our appeal thread with all information and our admins will decide what action to take.</li>
			</ol>
